/*
 * The functions here serve the mechanism that lets us schedule Lua
 * functions to run in the future.
 *
 * That mechanism is written in Lua: it's our Lua 'timer' module, which
 * exposes, notably, the functions set_timeout() and set_interval().
 *
 * The C side, this file, contains a few devices:
 *
 * First, it defines a timestamp data type (pit_t) whose resolution is
 * 1/1000 of a second. (Which makes it more useful than Unix' classic
 * 1-second resolution returned by time().) "pit" stands for "Point In
 * Time".
 *
 * Second, it defines a few primitive functions:
 *
 * - mc_lua_set_next_timeout() and mc_lua_timer_now(), which are used by
 *   the Lua side.
 *
 * - mc_lua_execute_ready_timeouts() and mc_lua_has_pending_timeouts(),
 *   which are used by the C side.
