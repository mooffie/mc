/**

Lua widgets are tables that contain a pointer (__cwidget__) to the C
widget. (We often, in this documentation, use the term "object" instead
of "table".)

We need a mapping between C pointers and Lua widgets. This is achieved
by the 'ui.weak' table. This mapping lets us:

 - When a C widget is destroyed, its Lua counterpart is located and the
   pointer is set to nil. next time Lua code calls method on this widget
   we know to raise exception instead of crash.

 - In C callbacks: finding the Lua object (and the associated 'onclick',
   'action', 'onchange' handlers).

The ui.weak table is where Lua widgets are registered (as explained
above).

In Lua 5.2+, Lua widgets that are in the process of being GC won't seem
to appear in this table. This means that this table won't serve its
purpose (and Bad Things will happen).

The truth is that Lua widgets being *values* in that table will indeed
disappear, but, fortunately, when they're *keys*, they'll still be
there.

So, in this situation, of being in a GC stage, what we need to do is to
search the ui.weak table a bit harder: instead of using the 'Widget *w'
as the lookup key, we traverse the table element by element till we find
the Lua widget whose value is this 'Widget *w'. That's why in
register_widget() we stored the relationship both ways.

This only needs to be used from mc_lua_notify_on_widget_destruction.

A section form Lua 5.2 manual explains this:

    "Resurrected objects (that is, objects being finalized and objects
    accessible only through objects being finalized) have a special
    behavior in weak tables. They are removed from weak values before
    running their finalizers, but are removed from weak keys only in the
    next collection after running their finalizers, when such objects
    are actually freed. This behavior allows the finalizer to access
    properties associated with the object through weak tables.

----

Here's an example of what can happen *without* our "searching hard":

  do
    local lbl = ui.Label("whatever")
    local dlg = ui.Dialog()

    dlg:add(lbl)
    dlg:run()
  end

  collectgarbage()
  collectgarbage()

The label and the dialog both get GCed. They both "vanish" (in Lua 5.2+)
from ui.weak. The dialog happens to get its __gc called first. Its __gc
calls dlg:destroy(), which calls a C function which destroys all the C
widgets. When the label gets destroyed, from the C side,
mc_lua_notify_on_widget_destruction() tries to find this label's Lua
counterpart to zero its __cwidget__ field, but it *can't find* this Lua
counterpart. Next, the __gc of 'lbl' is called and down the chain it
calls some function that access __cwidgte__, which points to *invalid*
memory address.
