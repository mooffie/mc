/**
 * Enables "reentrancy".
 *
 * Note-short: This function is very seldom needed. Feel free to ignore it.
 *
 * By default, timers don't fire while a scheduled function is already
 * running. This is a feature intended to prevent the following code from
 * "blowing up" your application with alert boxes:
 *
 *    timer.set_interval(function() alert('bomb!') end, 100)
 *
 * Info: This issue only exists when the scheduled function calls the event
 * loop (i.e., when it opens a dialog). It's the event loop that fires the
 * timers (remember: MC isn't multithreaded). So if your function doesn't
 * open a dialog, no timer will ever get the chance to fire anyway.
 *
 * If you want to disable this protective feature, call `timer.unlock()` at
 * the start of your scheduled function: this will fool the system to think
 * that no scheduled code is currently running.
 *
 * Note: there's no corresponding `lock()` function: the lock flag is
 * automatically set when a scheduled function is called.
 *
