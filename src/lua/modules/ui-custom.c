/**
 * Draw handler.
 *
 * This is where you draw the contents of your widget. Typically you fetch a
 * @{ui.Canvas|canvas} object and use its drawing methods:
 *
 *    wdg.on_draw = function(self)
 *      local c = self:get_canvas()
 *      c:erase()
 *      c:draw_string("hi!")

 * normal dialog color (appropriate for the active @{ui.colorset|colorset})
 * and the cursor is positioned at the widget's top-left corner.
 *
 * @method on_draw
 * @args (self)
 * @callback
 */

/**
 * Cursor positioning handler.
 *
 * This handler is called to position the cursor. It is only called for
 * widgets that have the @{on_focus|focus}.
 *
 *    wdg.on_cursor = function()
 *      wgt:get_canvas():goto_xy(point.x, point.y)
 *    end
 *
 *    -- To make our widget focusable, we must also do:
 *    wdg.on_focus = function() return true end
 *
 * You'll always want to implement this handler for focusable widgets
 * or else the cursor will remain at its last arbitrary position.
 *
 * @method on_cursor
 * @args (self)
 * @callback
 */

/**
Keypress handler.

This is where you respond to a key pressed when your widget has the focus.

The handler gets as argument the *keycode*. It should return **true** if
the key was handled.

    local K_LEFT = tty.keyname_to_keycode('left')
    local K_RIGHT = tty.keyname_to_keycode('right')
    ...

    wgt.on_key = function(self, keycode)
      if keycode == K_LEFT then
        pos.x = pos.x - 1
      elseif keycode == K_RIGHT then
        pos.x = pos.x + 1
      ...
      else
        return false
      end

      self:redraw()
      return true
    end

The above bulky code can be made to look more friendly:

    local K = utils.magic.memoize(tty.keyname_to_keycode)

    wgt.on_key = function(self, keycode)

      if keycode == K'left' then
        pos.x = pos.x - 1
      elseif keycode == K'right' then
        pos.x = pos.x + 1
      elseif keycode == K'up' then
        pos.y = pos.y - 1
      elseif keycode == K'down' then
        pos.y = pos.y + 1
      else
        return false
      end

      self:redraw()
      return true
    end

Or you can use a dispatch table:

    local K = utils.magic.memoize(tty.keyname_to_keycode)

    local navigation = {
      [K'left'] = wgt.go_left,
      [K'right'] = wgt.go_right,
      [K'up'] = wgt.go_up,
      [K'down'] = wgt.go_down,
    }

    wgt.on_key = function(self, keycode)
      if navigation[keycode] then
        navigation[keycode](self)
        self:redraw()
        return true
      end
    end

[info]

More examples for handling keys:

- A dialog's on_key -- @{git:accessories/find-as-you-type.lua},
  @{git:apps/visren/dialog.lua}.

- A canvas's on_key or on_hotkey --
  @{git:tests/nonauto/ui_canvas.mcs|tests/ui_canvas.mcs},
  @{git:screensavers/simplest.lua}, @{git:games/blocks/dialog.lua}.

[/info]

[tip]

If you want to know a key's name, temporarily turn your key handler
into:

    wgt.on_key = function(self, k)
      alert(tty.keycode_to_keyname(k))
      return true
    end

Note that @{tty.keycode_to_keyname} returns two names. The second --due
to the way multiple values are passed around in Lua-- will be displayed
as the @{prompts.alert|alert}'s title.

 * indicated a tad later: when you release the button. (However, since
 * you'll be using @{on_click}, as you should, you don't need to be aware
