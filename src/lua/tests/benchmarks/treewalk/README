These scripts benchmark various ways to traverse a directory tree.

We test:

(1) Lua: the luxposix module ( https://github.com/luaposix/luaposix )
(2) Lua: MC (our 'fs' module)
(3) Ruby
(4) Python

Not surprisingly, (1) is faster than (2). That's because MC uses an
extra layer, the VFS, which needs to construct VPaths.

The surprising thing is that (2) is on a par with (3) and (4).
