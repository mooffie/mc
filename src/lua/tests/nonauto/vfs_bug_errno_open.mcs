-- Demonstrates an 'errno' bug in mc_open().

--[[

mc_open() (in lib/vfs/interface.c) returns "-EOPNOTSUPP" for unrecognized
filesystems (or when open() isn't supported for a filesystem).

(1) Why negative?! Seems like a mistake. (And as a side-effect, we report it as a useless "Unknown error -95" ...)

(2) It should be E_NOTSUPP (defined in vfs.h). "EOPNOTSUPP" is for sockets.
