This directory tree contains tests.

Tests that need MC to run have a '.lua' extension (run them by symlinking
to them in your Lua user folder). Otherwise they have a '.mcs' extension
which means that it's more convenient to run them with mcscript.

auto/

  Tests that don't require the user's intervention. You can run them with
  mcscript.

nonauto/

  Tests that require the user's inspection or interaction. Read their
  headers to see what they're trying to achieve.

  Most of them you can run with mcscript ('.mcs' extension). Some require
  MC ('.lua' extension).

  [comment]
  You can run '.mcs' scripts that test the GUI in MC too. But you'll have
  to change the "test()" call (in their source code) to something like
  "keymap.bind('C-whatever', test)". Otherwise you'd see some error
  message similar to "You can not use tty.get_cols() yet, because the UI
  has not been initialized".
