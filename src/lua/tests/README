This directory tree contains tests.

Tests that need MC to run have a '.lua' extension (run them by symlinking
to them in your Lua user folder). Otherwise they have a '.mcs' extension
which means that it's more convenient to run them with mcscript.

auto/

  Tests that don't require the user's intervention. You can run them with
  mcscript.

nonauto/

  Tests that require the user's inspection or interaction. Read their
  headers to see what they're trying to achieve.
