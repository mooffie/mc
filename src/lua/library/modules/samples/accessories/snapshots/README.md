Snapshots
---------

A snapshot is a recorded state of a single panel, or of
both panels, which you can restore whenever you like.

You can associate hotkeys with snapshots, for easier access.


The state
---------

By "state" we mean: directory, sort order, custom format string, etc.

You can choose to restore just the directory. You can also edit the
snapshots database (the "Raw" button) to keep only the state you
want; e.g., you can keep just the sorting order.


The listing
-----------

The listing shows some details about the snapshot. There's a column that
shows either "+" if the snapshot stores many settings, or " " if it stores
just the directory.
