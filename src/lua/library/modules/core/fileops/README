HISTORY AND RATIONALE

The original plan was to exposes MC's fileops (src/filemanager/file.c) to
Lua. However, it was soon discovered that MC's code wasn't quite
decoupled from the UI, and even if it were, trying to mold it to fit a
flexible scripting environment might have made everybody's life hard.

But it was felt that not providing fileops to the user would have been a
study in irony. So a quick pure Lua solution was written.

It turns out that this pure Lua solution is quite decent. It also allows
for experimentation, which is a good thing in this early stage of MC/Lua.
The use of coroutines makes it quite flexible.
