This directory contains:

(1) MC's core (in modules/core). "The core" is the the part of MC's Lua
    support that's written in Lua itself.

(2) MC's sample scripts (in modules/samples).

(3) Scripts installed by your administrator or distro.

    (3a) Modules should be placed in the modules/ directory.

    (3b) OTOH, files placed directly in this directory (that is, outside
         modules/) will be run automatically when MC starts, for all users.
         MC itself places no file here. This feature is reserved for
         administrators and distros who want to customize MC for their users.
