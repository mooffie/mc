Why does MC need scripting?
===========================

This document, which people are encouraged to edit and contribute to,
lists some benefits of having MC support an extension language.

language-neutral term "scripting support".

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Intro

At first, the idea of scripting MC seems absurd. After all, MC already
supports an excellent extension language for its domain: shell scripts.
MC deals with files. You don't need JavaScript to manipulate files.

Let's see some arguments to the contrary.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Preventing code bloat / Lean C core

By implementing features in Lua we keep the C core lean.

With this we unburden the core maintainers of swamps of work and free up
their time to work on the important issues.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## No need for "gurus"

Because programming in Lua is @{~#easier|easy}, the "average Joe" himself
can customize and develop his MC.

Features that previously could only be created by gurus (proficient in
both C and MC's internals) can now be created by novice programmers with
but a tiny fraction of the effort.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Sharing and distributing responsibilities

Since the Lua side is organized in modules, features can be implemented
and maintained by, or "outsourced" to, individuals and groups outside
MC's core team.

Because of the different nature of C and Lua, the community at large can
take greater part in contributing and maintaining code.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Peace of mind for all

It's not uncommon for tickets to sit in the queue for years.

Many such tickets simply can't be resolved:

- Either because their solution, or their _importance_, is a matter of
personal taste;

- Or because the maintainers feel that some patches, albeit providing
some useful functionality, aren't critical enough to offset the cost in
maintenance liability that would be incurred henceforth. "Code bloat" too
comes to mind.

[indent]

This is a legitimate concern. While ignored/rejected patches are a sad
story, it would be sadder still to saddle MC's core with more and more
code.

[/indent]

This leaves many users @{3004|frustrated and embittered}.

This also, no doubt, has a toll on the maintainers, who have to face a
growing list of unresolvable tickets and fend off demands from users.

Lua __solves this problem__ by eliminating it: code bloat is no more, and
"personal taste" is just a matter of @{require|require()}ing, or not, a
module, and customizing its settings.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Making the C code better

Some parts of MC's C code need refactoring.

Adding scripting support will propel this much needed refactoring,
leading to better code quality.

Exposing the C code to the outside world is also likely to reveal
previously-unknown bugs in it, requiring a fix.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Code reuse

Currently, MC is somewhat like a locked room: nothing can go out and
little can come in.

MC holds many treasures (VFS, widget library, string utilities, syntax
highlighting, etc.), but they can't be used by the world outside.
Conversely, MC can't use the many treasures the world outside has to
offer (except in a few places, using shell commands).

By exposing MC to scripting we lift these walls.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Tests

While it's possible to write tests @{git:tests/lib|in C}, writing them in
a scripting language is @{git:lua/tests/auto|another possibility} and is
usually easier.

**Regression tests**

Let's have an example demonstrating _regression tests_. These are tests
in which you compare the current behavior of the program to its previous
behavior in order to detect undesired effects of your modification to the
code.

Take for example a [certain family of bugs](https://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/2142)
in mcedit's syntax highlighting. Let's say that you've written a patch
to fix the problem. How do you know that your patch, which fixes the
problem for one syntax (say JavaScript) doesn't break other syntaxes
(say PHP or Haskell)?

The solution is simple and pleasant: Thanks to our Lua integration we can
@{~shots#htmlizer|convert a source file to HTML}. So we can create a
corpus of demonstrative source files in different languages (JavaScript,
PHP, Haskell, ...) and store together with them their correct highlighted
syntax in HTML form. The task of testing your patch would then be simple:
you'd run the script that generates the HTML files and if they now differ
from the old HTML files you'd know that your patch had undesired effects.
Inspecting the HTML tells you exactly how your patch fails.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Parsers hell

When a feature is needed in C, a parser is often devised to support it.

MC contains around two dozen parsers, ranging from the
"Extension file" parser to the "User defined" listing mode parser.

A relatively minor problem with these parsers is that each has
different rules, requiring users to study them first and nevertheless
[often](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/commit/68e813db551bc8b45d28bcfcf684f7e19da7fd2b)
[tripping](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/commit/e281ca2890c2af1107205d05c9ebcebe9fec21fd)
[them](http://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/1987#comment:4).

A more substantial problem with these parsers is that they're not
extensible. If we want to add a feature, we need to modify the parser
--often quite substantially. The effort involved, concerns about
introducing bugs, and breaking backward-compatibility may hold off,
sometimes indefinitely, the implementation of new features.

All these problems are solved by using an extension languages. Virtually
all such languages have a data structure suitable for describing a
configuration, whose literal also looks readable to non-programmers
(think Python's dictionaries, Ruby's hashes, Lua's tables, Lisp's
s-expressions, JSON, etc) and in some cases it's even possible to design
a DSL. Such data format is usually easily extensible (by adding keys to
the tables, which can be nested). For example, in the
@{git:linter.lua|linter} plugin the 'alternatives' key was added at a
late stage and didn't affect backward-compatibility.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Configuration hell

MC's configuration is strewn over many @{~#parser|kinds} of files, and
having various problems:

- Collecting: The user can't arrange his configuration in just one place
(one file, or one folder).

- Splitting: The user @{1633|can't} @{2948|split} a configuration over
several files.

- Cascading: The user can't combine configuration from several files.
I.e., you can't have a base configuration file and augment/override it
with yours. Configuration files are _mutually exclusive_. This creates
several problems:

[indent]

- if a user customizes a configuration file, he either
  @{1677|loses it on the next MC upgrade}, or it
  @{2772|becomes outdated}. This problem exists even for a basic file
  like the "extensions file".

- This poses an insurmountable problem for site administrators and
  @{1984|distributions} who want to augment the user's configuration.

[/indent]

- Combining: You can't @{3169|pull different portions} from different
configurations files.

- Programming: You can't use variables or conditional sections.

An extension language solves these problems because configuration then is
executable code. Whatever can be done in code applies to configuration as
well.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Giving new life to C patches

We've already mentioned that patches often sit in the ticket queue for years.

We've also explained that many such tickets are effectively unresolvable.

_Fortunately, scripting comes to the rescue:_

Many C patches become unnecessary: they can be rewritten in pure Lua.

Other C patches can benefit too: they can be rewritten to just
expose some functionality to Lua. They no longer need
to contain the user interaction part. Take for example
this big @{2979|bookmark manager} patch: if rewritten in Lua,
it would require adding __only about 10 lines__ to MC's C code, to support
the "frequency" field. The rest would be pure Lua.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## "Exponential growth" of features

When you add a feature to the C side, you end up having n+1 features.

When you also expose this single feature to the Lua side, you end up
having more than this one additional feature. Metaphoritcally speaking,
it's as if you now have n*n features. That's because with scripting you
can combine this feature with others. And use it to implement other, new
features.

Indeed, when one looks at the growing @{git:samples} tree one might get
the impression our Lua API is expansive. It isn't. The "samples" scripts
use a relatively small API.

In other words, "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts".

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Less bugs

C code, especially in a non trivial application like MC, is susceptible
to bugs.

Lua code has much, much less of this problem. It's not a matter of
opinion but of math: A feature implemented in 10 lines of high-level code
(Lua) has less room for bugs than the same feature implemented in 200
lines of low-level code ( C ).

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Easier coding

Another reason it's easier to code in Lua is because we provide an API to
the user.

When coding for MC in C, on the other hand, there isn't quite an API but
a series of moves one has to carry out in sequence, often depending on
one's situation (an issue addressed in @{~#better}).

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Implement features immediately

A user desiring some feature is no longer dependent on the willingness of
MC's maintainers to accept a patch.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Health

Last but not least, there are health issues with MC.

The key sequences one has to repeat ad nauseam to navigate among
directories in MC can hurt people with musculoskeletal disorders (CTS,
tendinitis, tenosynovitis, etc.).

(Similar issue exists with editing files. Because of
some @{git:editbox/locking.lua|locking snafu} you can't just press F4. You
have to visit each desktop, and verify each MC process, in every terminal
tab, lest the file is already being edited, before pressing F4.)

In fact, one reason mc^2 was started was because its programmer sought a
way to relieve the stress of this keyboard humping.

When users propose @{2719|various} "outlandish" features to solve their
specific needs, they're sometimes answered with skepticism or outright
derision. Which is not surprising: no two persons use their software the
same way. One person cannot necessarily understand another's needs and
predicaments.

Scripting solves this problem by empowering the user himself to create
his very own solutions, however wacky they seem to others. He no longer
needs to seek the approval or genius of others.
