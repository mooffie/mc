mc^2 is a branch of [Midnight Commander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander)
that supports scripting via the Lua programming language.

The aim of mc^2 is to instigate a public discussion about the merits
of scripting MC, in the hope that someday the idea will be accepted, in
one form or another, into the official MC distribution.

Specifically, mc^2 aims to prove:

- that to accomplish such feat there is _no need to modify MC's main code._

- that it consists of adding relatively _little, uncomplicated code_ to MC.

- that it introduces _very small maintenance liability._

- that it can help us _fight code bloat._

- that it can make MC's main code leaner and _better._

In other words, mc^2 is intended to dispel some misconceptions one
may have about "scripting" support, and is designed in a way that,
hopefully, won't antagonize MC's maintainers.

As for _why_ MC needs scripting, this is summarised
