====== Lua topics =========

- http://loop.luaforge.net/
  Object-oriented framework.


===== Interesting =====

  "ncurses alternative"

- images in console

===== Interesting: history =====

- Old versions of MC sometimes shed light on some decisions and strange
  variable names. The oldest the git repo has is MC 4.1.27, which is
  certainly an interesting reading.

- The VFS in MC is based on AVFS:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf/

  It's interesting to see its evolution. You can even download
  version 0.2 (avfs-0.2.tar.gz).

==== Learn Lua integration from others ========

- package "libquvi-scripts"

- VLC

- Ipe

- "Links with Lua extensions" (a text www browser)

- WeeChat (supports several language engines; it could be interesting to compare the bindings)

= C =

- Conky's Cairo.

- http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/wxscript/

  "A set of abstract classes to add a script-interpreter support to your
   wxWidgets applications/libraries. The implementation of these interfaces
   for the Lua, Python, UnderC and CINT interpreters (these two are C/C++
   intepreters) are provided. The advantage of a single basic interface
   makes extremely easy for the programmer not only to add scripting
   support to its program but also to give the user multi-scripting
   languages support, learning how to use a single set of powerful classes:
   wxPython, wxLua, wxUnderC and wxCINT. These classes are easily
   extensible and they support Unicode as well."

- wxLua

- https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea    (not Lua)

  "Liferea 1.10+ support GObject Introspection based plugins using
   libpeas. The Liferea distribution comes with a set of Python plugin e.g.
   the media player, GNOME keyring support, a tray icon plugin and maybe
   others."

   http://lzone.de/Writing-Liferea-Plugins-Tutorial-Part-1

     "The important point is: by Liferea using GI (as all GNOME applications
      and many other GTK applications do now) plugins can be written in
      practically any scripting language."

- man 8 udisks:

  "a library, libudisks2 is also provided. This library can be used from
  C/C++ and any high-level language with GObjectIntrospection support such
  as Javascript and Python."


======= Ideas for samples ==========

Fields
  index: show running number (nah! better to print "5/728" at bottom!)
  bm: show "B"/"*" if there are bookmarks/position saved.
  package: show the package a file belongs to (via 'dpkg --search path'(?) or wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgfile)
    (No, perhaps we should do that in "Quick view" (see "quickview" in TICKETS-SOLVED.md for
    related ideas. On the other hand, it would be best to allow users to extent "Quick view" via
    a shell script (@todo: open a ticket); no need for Lua).)

  Warn, using a docked lanel, if the shell has something typed into
    it (see #2110, #213).
  Mounting/listing devices.
    see #1488.
    'man 8 udisks' says "for desktop applications it is a much better idea to
    use something like GVolumeMonitor". See also wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udisks .

Environment variables editor?
  "Versions 2.05 and later of bash use a different format for the output of
   the set builtin, designed to make evaluating its output easier. However,
   this output is not compatible with earlier versions of bash (or with
   many other shells, probably)."


===== Misc =====

- luaposix ( /usr/share/lua/5.1/posix.lua ) does some arithmetic with timestamps.
  Perhaps there's some idea there that can help us get rid of timer.c's division?

- The screenshots currently in ldoc are huge. Here are some to prove there are
  small and pleasant fonts:
