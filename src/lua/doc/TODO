(Items that require a lengthy explanation are put in the file 'TODO.long'.)

vpath
  - Have decent dirname(), basename(), join(), which support the VFS. The couple at
    'utils.path' are ad-hoc.
  - Have an fs.mkdir_p() which does support the VFS (in contrast to fs.nonvfs_mkdir_p()).
  - i18n: do we need ui.Panel:to_tty (a la ui.Editbox:to_tty)? Where are filenames and/or
    directories get encoded? (M-e)
  - Some file_slup module (used at http://lua-users.org/wiki/GotoStatement) has
    a useful readfile('shell command', 'p') function. We should have something similar
    instead of the read_command() we improvise in several of our sample modules.


ui
  - Use a nicer dialog for alert()? I.e., use C's query_dialog() instead of message()?
    Should we name the button "OK" or "Dismiss"?
  - Mimicking DLG_TRYUP in Lua: see ui_dialog_tryup.lua. Should we make Lua's calculation
    identical to C's?
  - Bug: <<Dialog::open>> is called for modaless dialogs whenever they're switched to.
  - Bug: <<Dialog::activate>> seems to be called only for the filemanager. And it lacks ldoc.
  - Have <<Dialog::cancel>>, to complement <<Dialog::submit>>?
  - Have property dialog.title, as an alias for dialog.text?


build
  - Do we really need the '$(PCRE_CPPFLAGS)' in our makefiles? (The new makefile
    at ticket #3547 too has it.)
  - Use of GINT_TO_POINTER, in luafs*.c, now generates warning because of -Wbad-function-cast:

      "warning: cast from function call of type 'int' to non-matching type 'void *' [-Wbad-function-cast]
        #define GINT_TO_POINTER(i) ((gpointer) (gint) (i))"


misc
  - Module samples.libs.locking-impl fails loudly if the filesystem was
    mounted read-only. This must be fixed: MC is often used for OS rescue.
  - Have versions of fs.utime() and luafs::utime() that support nanoseconds.
  - See if http://getmoai.com/forums/luajit-traceback-in-coroutine-t2662/
    anyhow applies to us (LuaJIT "debug mode").
  - git-related features (fields, etc.) cause error message printed (stderr) when
    the repository is not valid (right after "git init").
  - Ask MC's maintainers to add '--leave-preprocessor-space' (short: '-lps') to
    indent's invocation in doc/HACKING (for our capi.h).


ldoc
  - Use better colors for code snippet?
    (see http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styles/index.html
     and http://swfoo.com/?p=632 )
  - mc.css: Have a different style for notes/tips? Firefox doesn't manage the rounded
    corners well. Trac's site "solves" this by using shadow instead (
    http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracGuide )
